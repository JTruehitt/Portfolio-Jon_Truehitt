# Jon Truehitt's Portfolio

## Description
For this project, I was tasked with creating my first professional portfolio page using the skills I’ve learned through the first two weeks of the bootcamp. This included laying out the page with semantic HTML elements, utilizing flex and grid for a responsive page at different viewport sizes, and various CSS components to add styling and interactivity to my page, among other things. This is my first page built from scratch, and I’m very happy with how it turned out. I learned so much during this process that I can’t wait to apply to my future projects. 

As mentioned in the “About Me” section on the page, I don’t actually have any other projects at the time of creating this to fill in the “Projects” section. Due to this, I’ve just used placeholder images that I found aesthetically pleasing and linked to the theme board where I found them all. As I progress in the course, I intend to update this page and fill in actual projects as I create them.
